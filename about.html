            <h2 class="mb-4" style="text-align: center">Why the Foundation</h2>
            <p>
              Nigeria is made up of a diverse but relatively young population.
              It is estimated that 60 per cent of Nigeria's population is under
              the age of 25, making it one of the youngest countries in Africa.
              While this should ordinarily be an advantage, however, the youth
              population in Nigeria is faced with many challenges. For example,
              as of 2020, around 68 per cent of the young people in Nigeria had
              secondary education as their highest educational level. This also
              has implications for the youth unemployment rate, which has been
              increasing steadily since 2015, and as of 2021, stood at 19.6%
              (ILO, 2023). An earlier report by the National Bureau of
              Statistics (NBS) indicated that about 53% of 151 million Nigerian
              youths, numbering over 80 million, are unemployed, making Nigeria
              the second-highest number of unemployed youths in the world
              (Foundation for Investigative Journalism, 2023). Several factors
              ranging from a large population, lack of jobs, and deficient
              school curricula, among others, have been given for the high
              unemployment figures (Akande, 2014). The consequences of rising
              crime in the country cannot be overemphasized (Ayinla and
              Ogunmeru, 2018), with 70% of Nigeria's Youth said to be involved
              in crime as a result of poverty and lack of economic
              opportunities. According to Dambazau (2007) and Adebayo ( 2013),
              the nature of these crimes includes armed robbery, murder, rape,
              car theft, burglary, fraud, bribery and corruption, food and drug
              adulteration, gambling, smuggling, human trafficking, kidnapping,
              drug trafficking, money laundering, internet scam, advanced fee
              fraud and other illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to harness the potential of the young population
              in Nigeria for national development. Although governments at the
              state and national levels have embarked on programmes to make
              women and young persons more engaged and productive, it is
              essential that other non-state actors should be involved in the
              efforts towards youth empowerment and development. This is why the
              Bisi Akande Foundation is being set up.

              The Man Chief Adebisi Akande
            </h2>
            <p>
              Chief Adebisi Akande, well known and popularly called Bisi Akande
              is the Asiwaju of Ila Orangun, and the first civilian executive
              Governor of Osun State. He is the founding chairman of the All
              Progressives Congress (APC). Chief Bisi Akande was born on January
              16, 1939 at Ila-Orangun in the present State of Osun, Nigeria. By
              parentage, he comes from a long line of highly-respected warriors
              and administrators. His father, Pa Lawani Bamgbose Akande, was a
              grandson of Pa Ladimeji of Ile Asudan, Isedo quarters, Ila
              Orangun, who was one of the Generals in the Yoruba inter-tribal
              wars. His mother, Madam Hunmuani Akande, was a daughter to Chief
              Elemese Adesina of Ile Obalumo, Odo Ilegun (also in Isedo quarters
              of Ila-Orangun) — the traditional Head of Service in the kingdom
              of the Orangun of Ila.
            </p>
            <p>
              After his primary school education at Native Authority School, Oke
              Aloyin, lIa-Orangun (1946-1952) and at Methodist School,
              Ode-Idanre (in the present Ondo State) in 1953, Bisi Akande
              started life as a shop keeper with B.M. Akadiri at Oke-Ola in
              Odode, Idanre.He was subsequently lucky to become one of the
              pioneering teachers in the Obafemi Awolowo’s Free Primary
              Education programme (introduced in January 1955) at Ijama village
              of Idanre in the then Western Region of Nigeria. He later trained
              as a Grade III teacher at Divisional Teachers’ Training College,
              lle-lfe (1957 and 1958).
            </p>
            <p>
              During his teaching career in Muslim School, Omu-Aran (present
              Kwara state, 1959), Muslim School, Ilawo-EJigbo (present Osun
              state, 1960-1961), Catholic School, Oro (present Kwara
              state,1961-1962), and Mac-Job Grammar School, Abeokuta (present
              Ogun state, 1963), he pursued further education through
              correspondence courses from Wolsey Hall, Rapid Results College,
              and The School of Accountancy – all based in England.
            </p>
            <p>
              He joined the British Petroleum Nigeria Limited in August 1963 as
              a Manager-in-Training in the Finance and Accounts Department, and
              later attended several professional courses in several reputable
              institutions including:
            </p>
            <p>
              International Computers Limited Training College, Beaumont,
              Windsor, England (1974);
            </p>
            <p>London School of Computer Technology, England (1975);</p>
            <p>
              International Institute of Public Management, Washington, DC, USA
              (1979).Chief Bisi Akande worked for British Petroleum from 1963 to
              1979 when, as Manager, System and Computer Services, he left (on a
              Leave of Absence) to serve in the Government of the old Oyo State:
              first as Secretary to the Government and, subsequently, in
              November 1982, he became the Deputy Governor to Chief Bola Ige.
            </p>
            <p>
              Side by side with his job with BP, between 1963 and 1978, Chief
              Akande involved himself with various local town union activities.
              At various times, he served as a member of the Ila Students Union;
              member, Ila Grammar School Board of Governors; Convener, Ila
              Emancipation League; Secretary and member of the Ila Union in
              Lagos; member, Secretary, Treasurer and President (consecutively)
              of Ila Charity Club; Finance Coordinator of Ila Electricity
              Planning Committee; member, Osun North-East Consultative
              Committee, etc, etc, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the process, in 1971, he was appointed by the Military as a
              member of Ila Local Government Management Committee and, in 1976,
              he was elected unopposed as a councillor for Isedo Ward 1 into Ila
              Local Government Council.  In 1977, he was also elected to
              represent Ila/Odo-Otin Local governments in the Nigerian
              Constituent Assembly that wrote the 1979 Nigerian constitution.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the Constituent Assembly, Chief Bisi Akande met many Nigerian
              leaders like Shehu Shagari, Ibraheem Gusau, Tatari Alli, Ibrahim
              Tahir, Solomon Lar, Prof Shiayo, Paul Unongo, Adamu Attah, Sam
              Mbakwe, Sylvester Ugoh, Ambrose Alli, Richards Akinjide, Prof
              Tugbiyele, Abraham Adesanya, Bisi Onabanjo, Ayo Fasanmi and a host
              of others.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was Ayo Fasanmi who attracted Bisi Akande to Chief Obafemi
              Awolowo and from then he joined the Committee of Friends through
              which he became a foundation member of the Unity Party of Nigeria
              (UPN). At the 1978 old Oyo State congress of UPN, Chief Bisi
              Akande was elected into the state Executive Committee of the
              party. He subsequently got elected as its State Deputy Chairman,
              thereby becoming a member of UPN’s National Executive Committee
              under the chairmanship of Chief Obafemi Awolowo.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Military seized power in December 1983, Chief Bisi
              Akande was arrested along with Chief Bola Ige and he was jailed
              for 42 years imprisonment for what the Military described as
              ‘conspiracy to unlawfully enrich the Unity Party of Nigeria’. He
              was released in 1986 before the Military passed the decrees that
              later enabled the Military itself to enrich lavishly the Social
              Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention
              (NRC), the two political parties established by the Military to
              plan its self-succession.
            </p>
            <p>
              Happily, however, Chief Bisi Akande was vindicated by his own
              people who overwhelmingly voted for him to represent
              Ila/Ifedayo/Boluwaduro/Boripe Local governments at the
              Military-sponsored Constitutional Conference under General Sani
              Abacha. After winning the election, he snubbed the Military and
              boycotted the conference in obedience to the directives of
              Afenifere and the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO). And that
              was part of what led to the big “June 12” protests and the
              cat-and-mouse bloody scrambles between NADECO and Abacha’s
              Military administration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following the demise of Gen Abacha and Chief MKO Abiola and the
              military disengagement from Nigerian political administration,
              Chief Bisi Akande, as the Chairman of Afenifere for Osun state
              since 1995, co-founded the Alliance for Democracy (AD) - a
              political party on which platform he contested and won elections
              to become the governor of Osun state (1999-2003). His tenure as
              governor was most remarkable and singularly spectacular for the
              unprecedented infrastructural development in Osun state. He
              thereafter rose to become a leading light among the Yoruba
              leadership and a famous Nigerian statesman.
            </p>
            <p>
              In December 2003, in controversial circumstances, Chief Bisi
              Akande was persuaded by his colleagues (the former AD governors)
              to accept to be the National Chairman of the Alliance for
              Democracy. As soon as his nomination became supported by the only
              then serving governor of AD (Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu), certain
              leaders became irked and furtively sponsored an alternative
              national chairman who, they claimed, enjoyed the support of the
              Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidency, thereby throwing AD
              into two factions. In the litigation that ensued, the Bisi Akande
              faction was finally adjudged to be the authentic AD by the Appeal
              Court of Nigeria. However, in December 2006, Akande decided to
              resign and subsequently contested for and accepted the
              chairmanship of the newly-formed Action Congress (AC). In 2010, at
              the Benin City Convention, Chief Akande was unanimously elected,
              again, as the National Chairman of the Action Congress of Nigeria
              (ACN). He is the Founding National Chairman of the current ruling
              All Progressives Congress (APC).
            </p>
            <p>
              In recognition of Chief Bisi Akande’s indomitable courage,
              fighting spirit and a knack for adventures reminiscent of his
              warrior-ancestors, he has been conferred with the traditional
              chieftaincy titles of: Asiwaju of lIa-Orangun (his home town), as
              well as Agba Akin of Oke-Ila Orangun, Balogun of Aramoko-Ekiti
              (from where his ancestors migrated to Ila Orangun during the
              Yoruba wars), Jagunmolu-Oodua of Ijebu-Ife, Apesin of Ilashe-Ijesa
              and Bashorun of Ilobu.
            </p>
            <p>
              His antecedents make him a first-class progressive with deep
              affection for education and inclusive development hence the need
              for a Foundation in his honour to propagate his ideals. These
              ideals are good governance, community service as well as
              leadership by example.
